# Upgrading procedure

1. Check the version you are running (client) and server:

```
sudo kubectl version --short
Client Version: v1.12.7
Server Version: v1.12.8
```

Look for the release you want to ugprade (I believe we can't go directly to 1.14.2 so upgrading to 1.13.6)
```
apt-cache policy kubeadm
```


unlock kubeadm and upgrade it to `1.13.6`:

```
apt-mark unhold kubeadm && \
apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.13.6-00 && \
apt-mark hold kubeadm
```

check the release you are now:

```
kubeadm version
kubeadm version: &version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"13", GitVersion:"v1.13.6", GitCommit:"abdda3f9fefa29172298a2e42f5102e777a8ec25", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-05-08T13:51:38Z", GoVersion:"go1.11.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```

Now you can run upgrade plan and check if you can upgrade your cluster:

```
kubeadm upgrade plan
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks.
[upgrade] Making sure the cluster is healthy:
[upgrade/config] Making sure the configuration is correct:
[upgrade/config] Reading configuration from the cluster...
[upgrade/config] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -oyaml'
[upgrade] Fetching available versions to upgrade to
[upgrade/versions] Cluster version: v1.12.8
[upgrade/versions] kubeadm version: v1.13.6
I0605 05:51:12.742339   11326 version.go:237] remote version is much newer: v1.14.2; falling back to: stable-1.13
[upgrade/versions] Latest stable version: v1.13.6
[upgrade/versions] Latest version in the v1.12 series: v1.12.9

Components that must be upgraded manually after you have upgraded the control plane with 'kubeadm upgrade apply':
COMPONENT   CURRENT       AVAILABLE
Kubelet     3 x v1.12.7   v1.12.9

Upgrade to the latest version in the v1.12 series:

COMPONENT            CURRENT   AVAILABLE
API Server           v1.12.8   v1.12.9
Controller Manager   v1.12.8   v1.12.9

Etcd                 3.2.24    3.2.24

You can now apply the upgrade by executing the following command:

	kubeadm upgrade apply v1.12.9

You can now apply the upgrade by executing the following command:

	kubeadm upgrade apply v1.13.6
```

so at this stage we execute the upgrade:

```
kubeadm upgrade apply v1.13.6
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks.
[upgrade] Making sure the cluster is healthy:
[upgrade/config] Making sure the configuration is correct:
[upgrade/config] Reading configuration from the cluster...
[upgrade/config] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -oyaml'
[upgrade/apply] Respecting the --cri-socket flag that is set with higher priority than the config file.
[upgrade/version] You have chosen to change the cluster version to "v1.13.6"
[upgrade/versions] Cluster version: v1.12.8
[upgrade/versions] kubeadm version: v1.13.6
[upgrade/confirm] Are you sure you want to proceed with the upgrade? [y/N]: y
```

now upgrade the kubelet on the master node:

```
apt-mark unhold kubelet && \
apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubelet=1.13.6-00 && \
apt-mark hold kubelet
```

at the end the control plane (master node) should be upgraded at this point:

```
kubectl get nodes

NAME                           STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
1c.mylabserver.com   Ready    master   15d   v1.13.6
2c.mylabserver.com   Ready    <none>   15d   v1.12.7
3c.mylabserver.com   Ready    <none>   15d   v1.12.7
```

2. Upgrade kubectl in all the worker nodes


```
apt-mark unhold kubectl && \
apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubectl=1.13.6-00 && \
apt-mark hold kubectl
```

3. Upgrade kubeadm and kubelet in all the worker nodes

```
apt-mark unhold kubelet kubeadm
apt-get update
apt-get install -y kubelet=1.13.6-00 kubeadm=1.13.6-00
apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm
```

4. At the end the output should be similar to this:

```
kubectl get nodes
NAME                           STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
1c.mylabserver.com   Ready    master   15d   v1.13.6
2c.mylabserver.com   Ready    <none>   15d   v1.13.6
3c.mylabserver.com   Ready    <none>   15d   v1.13.6
```
