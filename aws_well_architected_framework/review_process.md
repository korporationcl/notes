# The Review Process

The review of architectures needs to be done in a consistent manner, with a blamefree approach that encourages diving deep. It should be a light-weight process
(hours not days) that is a conversation and not an audit. The purpose of reviewing an architecture is to identify any critical issues that might need addressing or areas that
could be improved. The outcome of the review is a set of actions that should improve the experience of a customer using the workload.
